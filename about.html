    <h1>Skateboarding 101</h1>
    <h2>This page is for anyone to learn the core foundations within skateboarding to help you build confidence, knowledge of trick names and what they look like along with some termonolgy within the sport
        beacuse a lot of the time if you listen to to skateboarders having a conversation about what they are trying it can sound like absolute gibberish. You will find what you are looking for within the top
        navbar wether it is terms or tricks that you want to know about.
